The old wooden dock creaked beneath my feet as I watched the sunset paint the sky in shades of amber and rose. The smell of saltwater mixed with pine from the nearby forest created a scent that instantly transported me back to childhood summers spent here with my grandmother. She would tell stories of her own youth, when this very dock was new and the town was half its current size. Now, standing here alone, I can almost hear her laughter carried on the evening breeze.
