I burned the toast again this morning. Not just a light browningâ€”I'm talking full-on charcoal briquette status. The smoke alarm started screaming, the cat bolted under the couch, and my roommate stumbled out of her room looking like she'd just survived an apocalypse. "Seriously?" she groaned, waving a dish towel at the ceiling. I just shrugged and poured myself some cereal. Some people are not meant to use toasters unsupervised, and I have finally accepted that I am one of those people.
