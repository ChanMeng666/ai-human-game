My daughter came home from kindergarten today with a drawing of our family. I'm apparently a giant purple blob with stick legs, my husband is inexplicably wearing a cape, and our dog has six legs and what I think might be laser eyes. When I asked her about the creative choices, she just said "That's how I see you guys" and went back to eating goldfish crackers. I've never been more honored to be depicted as a purple blob in my entire life.
